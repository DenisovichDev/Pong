# Pong
This is a classic (almost) pong made in Python using the pygame library. But it has also a machine learning extension where the AI plays the game according to its training using the nearest neighbour algorithm.

The computerphile YouTube mini series on Pong and Data Science with Dr. Isaac Triguero is the reason we started making this game. This was most possibly the first time we used the pygame GUI library to make a programme, so it was quite hard for us to make initially. Dr. Triguero's video helped us to get through that. We are grateful to Brady Haran for giving birth to the YouTube channel, and also to Sean Riley for filming the wonder videos.
